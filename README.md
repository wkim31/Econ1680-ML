# Econ1680-ML

ML Project for Econ 1680: 

The purpose of this project is to develop a multiclass classification model on whether a bank gets acquired by national, regional, or no bank based on balance sheet metrics. The file can be downloaded either from the FDIC website: https://www.fdic.gov/resources/resolutions/bank-failures/failed-bank-list/ or Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utkarshx27/failed-banks-database/data
The main goal of this project is to distinguish balance sheet metrics based on the hand they play in bank failures in order to identify potential failures.
